        "* Machine learning ***pipelines*** create a nice workflow to combine data manipulations, preprocessing, and modeling\n",
        "* Machine learning pipelines can be used along with ***grid search*** to evaluate several parameter settings \n",
        "  * Grid search can considerably blow up computation time when computing for several parameters along with cross-validation\n",
        "  * Some models are very sensitive to hyperparameter changes, so they should be chosen with care, and even with big grids a good outcome isn't always guaranteed"
